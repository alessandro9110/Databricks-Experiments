# Databricks Experiments🚀

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains experiments, labs, and prototypes developed on Databricks to explore the integration of Data, Machine Learning, and AI technologies.
The goal is to provide practical examples, reusable assets, and end-to-end workflows for learning, prototyping, and deploying solutions in Databricks environments.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- Building a Knowledge Assistant with Agent Bricks: Labs and code for creating a Knowledge Assistant using Agent Bricks on Databricks.
- Certifications/Machine Learning Plan/Adv. Machine Learning at Scale: Material and labs for advanced machine learning experiments, including certification prep.
- Databricks AI-BI Genie: Experiments on integrating AI/BI Genie with Databricks for conversational dashboards and augmented analytics.
- Multi Agent System with Mosaic AI Agent Framework: TO DO

Additional content will be added progressively, aligned with the editorial plan of technical articles on Databricks, Azure, and AI.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- A Databricks workspace (Community Edition or Enterprise).
- Python 3.9+
- Installed dependencies (see requirements.txt if available, otherwise install directly inside Databricks clusters).
